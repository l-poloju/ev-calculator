- Increase Range Importance to 5, decrease Speed/Acceleration importance
- Radar chart emphasizes efficiency and range metrics
- Perfect for daily commuters and long-distance travelers

### **For Performance Enthusiasts**
- Increase Power and Acceleration importance to 5
- Radar chart highlights power-to-weight ratio and acceleration metrics
- Ideal for sports car enthusiasts and performance comparison

### **For Efficiency-Minded Users**
- Increase Energy Efficiency and Drivetrain Efficiency importance
- Radar chart emphasizes energy consumption and system efficiency
- Great for environmentally conscious users and cost-conscious buyers

### **For Balanced Analysis**
- Keep all metrics at neutral (3) or adjust based on specific priorities
- Comprehensive view of all performance aspects
- Perfect for automotive engineers and analysts

## üöÄ **Deployment Status**

**Live URL**: https://xjebxhak.manus.space

### **Verified Functionality**
- ‚úÖ Vehicle Parameters dropdown with 3 presets
- ‚úÖ Custom input fields with real-time calculations
- ‚úÖ Performance Breakdown graph with proper scaling
- ‚úÖ Vehicle Performance Comparison with 4 vehicles
- ‚úÖ Multi-Dimensional Radar Chart with weighting controls
- ‚úÖ Performance Priority Controls with 6 customizable sliders
- ‚úÖ Export functionality (JSON/CSV)
- ‚úÖ All tabs working (Calculator, Comparison, Analysis, How It Works)

## üìä **Technical Specifications**

### **Calculation Improvements**
```javascript
// NEW: Realistic Range Calculation
const speed = 80; // km/h reference speed
const speedMs = speed / 3.6; // convert to m/s
const dragForce = 0.5 * 1.225 * dragCoefficient * frontalArea * Math.pow(speedMs, 2);
const rollingForce = weight * 9.81 * 0.01;
const totalForce = dragForce + rollingForce;
const powerRequired = totalForce * speedMs / 1000;
const energyConsumption = powerRequired / (efficiency / 100);
const range = (batteryCapacity / energyConsumption) * speed;
```

### **Weighting System**
- **Scale**: 1-5 (1 = Low Priority, 3 = Neutral, 5 = High Priority)
- **Application**: `normalized_value = base_value * (weight / 3)`
- **Real-time Updates**: Radar chart recalculates immediately when sliders change
- **Capped Values**: Maximum normalized value is 100 to maintain chart readability

## ‚úÖ **Quality Assurance**

### **Tested Scenarios**
1. **Preset Selection**: All three presets load correctly and update all fields
2. **Custom Input**: Manual parameter changes reflect in all charts and metrics
3. **Graph Rendering**: All charts display proper data with correct scaling
4. **Weight Customization**: Sliders affect radar chart visualization in real-time
5. **Tab Navigation**: All four tabs function properly with persistent data
6. **Export Functions**: JSON and CSV export work correctly
7. **Responsive Design**: Interface works on different screen sizes

### **Performance Metrics**
