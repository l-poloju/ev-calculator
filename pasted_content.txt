EV Calculator – Final Enhancement Request
To ensure the EV Calculator is both easy to use for beginners and powerful enough for professionals, please implement the following design upgrades, features, and visual improvements.

This version should be intuitive, visually attractive, and data-rich, making it engaging and clear for first-time users, while also providing the depth and clarity expected by advanced users like engineers, data analysts, and automotive professionals.

🎯 1. Title & Branding
The title has already been updated to “EV Calculator”.

Add a subtle watermark with the name “l.poloju” in one of the bottom corners (ideally bottom-right). It should:

Be clearly visible but not distracting.

Maintain a clean and professional appearance.

📈 2. Performance & Comparison Visuals
Make the visuals self-explanatory, so even new users can instantly understand them, while also offering rich insights for experts.

➤ Performance Breakdown Graph
Add units to every axis and metric displayed.

Use color-coded bars to help users quickly identify performance categories (e.g., power, range, efficiency).

Make the graph dynamic and responsive to input changes.

➤ Comparison Section:
Show a side-by-side performance graph comparing:

A regular car

A sport (vsport) car

One additional vehicle (e.g., SUV, hybrid, or electric truck)

Highlight key metrics (acceleration, top speed, range, efficiency).

Add a Radar Chart for Multi-Dimensional Analysis:

Visually compare all vehicles on a normalized scale.

Clearly label each axis and highlight strengths using color cues (e.g., green for “best in class”).

🧠 3. Beginner-Friendly Yet Pro-Grade
The calculator should strike a balance:

✅ For First-Time Users:

Use tooltips or hover-info for each metric to explain what it means (e.g., “kWh: battery capacity”).

Include example vehicle inputs and preset scenarios.

Clear, minimal layout with simple inputs and real-time feedback.

🧠 For Advanced Users:

Provide raw data outputs, breakdowns of calculations, and ability to customize parameters.

Include a section for formulas used, with proper units and explanations.

Enable CSV or JSON export of performance data.

🎨 4. Design, Color & Usability
Use a modern, clean background instead of plain white.

Apply the following color palette for clarity, readability, and visual appeal:

Purpose	Name	Hex
Background/Base	White	#ffffff
Text/Dark UI	Black	#000000
Highlights/Good	Green	#009682
Graph Elements	Blue	#4664aa
Warnings/Notice	Yellow	#fce500
Accents/Buttons	Orange	#df9b1b

Use green (#009682) to highlight strong performance or positive metrics (e.g., best efficiency, top range).

Make the graphs more colorful and engaging, using contrast and color associations effectively.

🧮 5. Transparency & Understanding
Include a dedicated “How It Works” or “Formulas Used” section.

Clearly define the calculations, assumptions, and units for each metric.

Explain industry-standard terms like Wh/km, efficiency %, torque, and kWh.


🧲 Goal Recap
This calculator should be something a first-time EV buyer can understand in minutes, but also something an automotive engineer or data analyst can trust for meaningful comparisons and insights.
